# WebScraper for IMDB

This is a simple python webscraper to get a list of top shows from IMDB.

## Usage

The application shows a recommendation based on a random pick from the IMDB website url (https://www.imdb.com/chart/top-english-movies)
There is a prompt after each recommendation if the user wants to see another show title.

## Shout Out

The logic was based on a YT course by Patrick Loeber on IMDB scraping - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoPPgcpSmNs
